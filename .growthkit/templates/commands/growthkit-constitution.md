# /growthkit.constitution

Create or update project governance principles.

## Usage

Run this command to establish your project's constitution.

### Example

```
/growthkit.constitution Create principles focused on sustainable growth, product quality, community engagement, and ethical marketing. Ensure all campaigns validate against these principles.
```

## What This Does

This command will:

1. **Create/update `.growthkit/memory/constitution.md`** with:
   - Seven Core Principles for growth campaigns
   - Constitution Check gates (mandatory and advisory)
   - Growth Metrics Dashboard with 2025 benchmarks
   - Complexity Tracking for justified violations
   - Amendment process
2. **Establish governance** that all campaigns must follow:
   - **Mandatory gates**: MUST pass before planning
   - **Advisory gates**: Should be addressed in design
   - **Violations**: Must be explicitly justified
3. **Define project values** for:
   - Growth methodology (spec-driven, test-before-scale)
   - Viral loop strategy (Remix, Integration, Watermark)
   - Platform approach (native content, not generic)
   - Community engagement (organic > paid)
   - Measurement strategy (primary, activation, engagement metrics)

## Seven Core Principles

1. **Spec-Driven Growth** - Every campaign has measurable specifications
2. **Viral Loop Engineering** - Remix, Integration, or Watermark loops built in
3. **Agent-First Architecture** - Content optimized for LLM citation
4. **Measurement-First Development** - Metrics defined upfront
5. **Multi-Platform Distribution** - Platform-specific tactics (X: 16:9, TikTok: 9:16)
6. **Test-Before-Scale** - Pilot phases with validation gates
7. **Community-Led Amplification** - Organic reach over paid ads

## Mandatory Constitution Check Gates

All campaigns must pass these before planning:

- ✓ Campaign spec exists
- ✓ Growth type identified (Vibe/Trust/Agentic)
- ✓ Target audience is specific (not generic)
- ✓ Viral loop mechanism defined
- ✓ k-factor target set (>1.1)
- ✓ Metrics defined (primary, activation, engagement)
- ✓ Pilot phase scoped (<10% budget)

## Next Steps

1. Review `.growthkit/memory/constitution.md` - is this what your team believes?
2. Adjust principles if needed - constitution should reflect your values
3. Run `/growthkit.specify` to create first campaign
4. All subsequent campaigns validate against these principles

## Tips

- **Constitution guides all decisions** - Reference it when planning
- **Amendment process**: Vote or discuss before changing principles
- **Complexity Tracking**: Document justified violations explicitly
- **Regular review**: Quarterly reviews of constitution and benchmarks
