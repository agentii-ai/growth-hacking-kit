  IMPORTANT: This specification defines WHAT content you want to create and WHY.
  DO NOT include HOW it will be implemented (CMS, frameworks, hosting, tech stack).

  Focus on:
  - Content strategy and audience needs
  - Blog type and content pillars
  - Publishing cadence and success metrics
  - Distribution and engagement goals
  - SEO strategy and keyword targeting (content-level, not technical implementation)

  Technology choices belong in plan.md, NOT here.

## SEO Foundation *(mandatory - integrated at specification stage)*

<!--
  SEO begins at specification, not implementation. Define your content's search positioning here.
-->

### Primary Keyword Strategy

| Pillar | Target Keyword | Search Intent | Monthly Volume | Competition |
|--------|----------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| [Pillar 1] | [primary keyword] | [informational/transactional/navigational] | [estimate] | [low/medium/high] |
| [Pillar 2] | [primary keyword] | [intent] | [estimate] | [competition] |
| [Pillar 3] | [primary keyword] | [intent] | [estimate] | [competition] |

**Keyword Selection Criteria**:
- Target keywords with < 5,000 monthly search volume initially (lower competition)
- Prioritize long-tail keywords with high intent ("how to build X" vs "what is X")
- Validate search intent matches content type (informational for authority, transactional for practitioner)

### Content Cluster Strategy

**Hub Pages** (Pillar Content):
- Each pillar should have 1 comprehensive hub page (3,000-6,000+ words)
- Hub pages target primary keyword and link to all cluster posts
- Hub pages are updated quarterly with new cluster links

**Cluster Posts** (Supporting Content):
- 8-12 supporting posts per pillar
- Each cluster post targets a long-tail variation of pillar keyword
- All cluster posts link back to hub page (topical authority signal)

### E-E-A-T Signals

**Experience**: [How will content demonstrate real-world experience? e.g., "Production case studies from our deployments"]

**Expertise**: [What credentials/expertise will authors showcase? e.g., "Written by engineers who built the system"]

**Authoritativeness**: [How will content establish authority? e.g., "Original research, benchmarks, and methodology disclosure"]

**Trustworthiness**: [How will content build trust? e.g., "Limitations sections, honest failure documentation"]

## Blog Type Declaration *(mandatory)*

-->

**Blog Type**: [Authority | Practitioner | Community | Thought Leadership]

**Rationale**: [Why this blog type? What business/audience need does it address?]

**Content Strategy Alignment**:
- **Authority**: Deep research, original insights, canonical content (6-12 month ROI)
- **Practitioner**: Tutorials, how-to guides, production patterns (1-3 month ROI)
- **Community**: Contributor spotlights, case studies, user stories (ongoing engagement)
- **Thought Leadership**: Executive perspective, industry analysis, vision pieces (brand building)

---

## Example: Authority Blog for AI/LLM Developers

### SEO Foundation (Example)

| Pillar | Target Keyword | Search Intent | Monthly Volume | Competition |
|--------|----------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Production Agent Patterns | "production ai agent patterns" | Informational | ~2,400 | Low |
| Context Engineering | "llm context engineering" | Informational | ~1,800 | Low |
| Multi-Agent Orchestration | "multi agent orchestration" | Informational | ~3,200 | Medium |

**E-E-A-T Signals**:
- **Experience**: Production case studies from our own agent deployments
- **Expertise**: Written by engineers who built the systems
- **Authoritativeness**: Original benchmarks with full methodology disclosure
- **Trustworthiness**: Limitations sections documenting what doesn't work

### Blog Type Declaration

**Blog Type**: Authority

**Rationale**: Position our company as the canonical reference for building effective AI agents in production. Authority blog targets high-intent decision makers (CTOs, engineering leads) who need to understand patterns, trade-offs, and best practices before committing to a technology or architecture.

**Content Strategy Alignment**: Deep research, original insights, canonical content (6-12 month ROI). Each post establishes authority and becomes a referenced resource in industry discussions.

### Target Audience

**Primary Audience**:
- **Persona**: Senior ML/Software Engineers (5+ years) building production LLM systems
- **Use Cases**:
  - Evaluating whether to use agents vs. traditional ML
  - Understanding how to structure multi-agent systems reliably
  - Learning patterns for error handling and guardrails in production agents
- **Pain Points**:
  - Documentation is scattered across multiple sources
  - Most examples are demos, not production-grade code
  - No clear patterns for structuring complex agent workflows
- **Where They Are**: Hacker News, DEV.to, Engineering Twitter, AI Discord communities, LangChain Slack

### Content Pillars (Example with SEO)

**Pillar 1: Production-Grade Agent Patterns**
- **Problem Statement**: Engineers struggle to move AI agents from demos to production-grade systems
- **Target Keyword**: "production ai agent patterns"
- **Hub Page**: "The Complete Guide to Production AI Agent Patterns" (4,000 words)
- **Cluster Posts**:
  - "How to structure agents for reliability" → "ai agent reliability patterns"
  - "Error handling in multi-agent systems" → "multi agent error handling"
  - "Testing agents in staging vs production" → "testing ai agents production"
- **Evidence Sources**: Internal benchmarks (Tier 3), industry case studies (Tier 2)

**Pillar 2: Context Engineering for AI Systems**
- **Problem Statement**: LLM outputs are inconsistent because context is poorly architected
- **Target Keyword**: "llm context engineering"
- **Hub Page**: "Context Engineering for LLMs: A Production Guide" (3,500 words)
- **Cluster Posts**:
  - "Architecting prompts for consistency" → "llm prompt architecture"
  - "Measuring prompt performance" → "measuring llm prompt performance"
  - "Reducing hallucination through context" → "reduce llm hallucination"
- **Evidence Sources**: Academic papers on hallucination (Tier 1), our internal metrics (Tier 3)

### Publishing Cadence (with Capacity Validation)

**Frequency**: 4 posts/month (2 authority + 2 practitioner)

| Role | Available FTE | Hours/Week | Posts Supported |
|------|---------------|------------|------------------|
| Writer | 1.0 FTE | 40 hrs | 4 posts/month |
| SME/Reviewer | 0.25 FTE | 10 hrs | 4 reviews/month |
| Editor | 0.25 FTE | 10 hrs | 4 edits/month |

**Capacity Check**: 4 posts/month requires ~1.5 FTE. Team has 1.5 FTE available. ✅

### Success Metrics (with Milestones)
- **Organic Traffic**: M1: 2K | M3: 8K | M6: 20K | M12: 50K+
- **Keyword Rankings**: M3: 30% page 1 | M6: 50% page 1
- **Backlinks**: 50+ high-quality backlinks by Month 6
- **AI Citations**: 5+ citations in ChatGPT/Claude responses by Month 12
